## Project Title
### Arts and Culture Activities â€“ AI system to understand the values that underpin sector activities

## Project Description
### The Takso outcomes planning platform is a software as a service planning and evaluation platform for the arts and broader cultural policy areas of government. Takso records rich narrative data for any arts activity of any scale across all jurisdictions. Built on our peer-reviewed and published IP, Takso records a growing set of complex inputs, outputs and outcomes data and currently used on pilot sites in the Commonwealth, state and local governments. The problem is that understanding what the data tells us, as thousands of activities will be added, is beyond our human analysis, yet we know there is depth of knowledge on human values being recorded. For example, we have helped to build the culture around flight journey data and explained how the aviation industry has used the data to strengthen and grow. Now we also have datasets with other activities from the Arts & Culture sector and developing reports. We would like to analyze sentiment responses from participants in such activities (2 sets and 22 measures).This project will help us to justify the investment into Arts & Culture sector.
